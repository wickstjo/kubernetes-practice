// GET THINGS
    kubectl get services
    kubectl get pod
    kubectl get nodes
    kubectl get deployments

// CREATE
    PODS ARE NOT MANUALLY CREATED
    WE MANAGE THAT THROUGH DEPLOYMENTS

    kubectl create deployment NAME --image=IMAGE

// EDIT DEPLOYMENT FILE
    WE CAN FREELY EDIT AN EXISTING DEPLOYMENT FILE
    WHEN THE DEPLOYMENT FILE IS SAVED
        THE OLD INSTANCE IS AUTOMATICALLY TERMINATED
        AND A NEW ONE IS CREATED

    kubectl edit deployment nginx-depl

// INSPECT INSTANCE LOGS
    kubectl logs INSTANCE_HASH

// INTERACTIVE TERMINAL FOR POD
    kubectl exec -it INSTANCE_HASH

// DELETE DEPLOYMENTS
    kubectl delete DEPL_NAME

// APPLY
    INSTEAD OF MANUALLY DOING CHANGES/DEPLOYMENTS
    WE CAN JUST APPLY CHANGES VIA A YAML FILE

    kubectl apply -f FILEPATH

// DESCRIBE SERVICE
    kubectl describe service SERV_NAME

// GENERATE DEPLOYMENT DUMP FILE
    SNAPSHOT CURRENT BRAIN CONFIG

    kubectl get deployment DEPL_NAME -o yaml > filepath
