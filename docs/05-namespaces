NAMESPACES IN KUBERNETES WORK SIMILARLY TO C++
    SIMILAR COMPONENTS ARE ORGANIZED IN THE SAME NAMESPACES
    TO ALLOW FOR SCALABILITY WITHOUT LOSING READABILITY

GENERALLY UNNECESSARY FOR SMALLER PROJECTS
    WITH FEWER THAN 10 PEOPLE

NAMESPACES ARE GOOD FOR BLUE/GREEN DEPLOYMENT
WHERE THE TWO DIFFERENT PRODUCTIONS HAVE COMMON DEPENDENCIES

PEOPLE ASSIGNED TO ONE NAMESPACE DONT HAVE ACCESS
TO COMPONENTS IN ANOTHER NAMESPACE

HARDWARE LIMITS CAN ALSO BE SET FOR A NAMESPACE

NAMESPACES CANNOT SHARE CONFIGMAPS OR SECRETS
THEY MUST BE DUPLICATED

SERVICES HOWEVER CAN BE SHARED

VOLUMES AND PERSISTENT NODES CANNOT BE ASSIGNED TO A NAMESPACE

WHAT NAMESPACE A COMPONENT BELONGS MUST BE SPECIFIED
IN THE YAML CONFIG FILE UNDER THE FIRST METADATA SECTION

IF NONE IS MENTIONED, IT IS ASSIGNED TO DEFAULT
