// INGRESS
    ALLOWING DIRECT COMMUNICATION WITH A SERVICE IS BAD PRACTICE

    THE SAFER METHOD IS TO COMMUNICATE WITH AN INGRESS LAYER
    THAT FORWARDS QUERIES TO THE SERVICE LAYER

    AN INGRESS CONFIG ALONE IS NOT ENOGUH

// INGRESS CONTROLLER
    WE ALSO NEED AN INGRESS CONTROLLER THAT EVALUATES
    AND PROCESSES INGRESS RULES AND MANAGES REDIRECTS

    INGRESS CONTROLLERS MUST BE OBTAINED THROUGH
    THIRD PARTY IMPLEMENTATIONS, FOR EXAMPLE

    K8s Nginx Ingress Controller

    TO INSTALL A INGREE CONTROLLER IN MINIKUBE
        minikube adddons enable ingress

// CLOUD BACKEND
    IF YOURE USING A CLOUD SOLUTION LIKE AWS, THEIR OWN
    LOAD BALANCER USUALLY COMES FIRST IN THE STACK AND PIPES
    QUERIES INTO THE INGRESS CONTROLLER

// STANDALONE BACKEND
    IF NOT, THEN YOU NEED TO SETUP A PROXY SERVER
    THAT LOAD BALANCES AND PIPES QUERIES TO THE INGRESS CONTROLLER

// HTTP VS. HTTPS
    HTTP INGRESSING REQUIRES NO ADDITIONAL WORK
    TO ALLOW HTTPS, THE SPEC SECTION NEEDS TO INCLUDE A TLS PROPERTY
        THERE YOU NEED TO SPECIFY A SECRET TLS CERTIFICATES
