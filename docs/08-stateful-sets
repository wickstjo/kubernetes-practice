STATEFUL DEFINITION
    Stateful services keep track of sessions or transactions and
    react differently to the same inputs based on that history.

    - DEPLOYED USING STATEFULSET COMPONENTS


STATELESS DEFINITION
    Stateless services rely on clients to maintain sessions and
    center around operations that manipulate resources, rather
    than the state.

    - DEPLOYED USING DEPLOYMENT COMPONENT

BOTH COMPONENT TYPES ARE ABLE TO REPLICATE THEIR POD CONTAINERS
AND MANAGE DATA PERSISTENCY IN THE SAME WAY

THEY DO HOWEVER WORK QUITE DIFFERENTLY

WHILE DEPLOYMENT REPLICAS ARE IDENTICAL
STATEFUL REPLICAS HAVE A STICKY ID

WHEN A STATEFUL REPLICA DIES, A NEW ONE IS CREATED
AND ASSIGNED THE OLD STICKY ID

THIS IS TO AVOID DATA INCONSISTENCY CONFLICTS

// DATABASE EXAMPLE
    SAY THAT WE HAVE 3 STATEFUL REPLICA COMPONENTS
    ONLY ONE OF THEM WILL BE ABLE TO WRITE NEW DATA
    WHILE THE TWO OTHERS ARE ONLY ABLE TO READ EXISTING DATA

    IF MULTIPLE PODS COULD WRITE, INCONSISTENCY PROBLEMS WOULD
    QUICKLY ARISE

    WRITING PODS ARE CALLED MASTERS
    READING PODS ARE CALLED SLAVES

// FUNCTIONALITY
    ALL PODS CONTINUOUSLY SYNC SO THEIR STATES ARE THE SAME

    WHEN A NEW SLAVE POD IS ADDED, IT CLONES THE PREVIOUS PODS DATA
    SAME RULE APPLIES IF A SLAVE POD CRASHES

    THEREFORE, AS LONG AS ONE OF THE PODS REMAIN ALIVE
    NEW PODS CAN BE CREATED THAT THEN CLONE THEIR DATA FROM THE SURVIVOR

    IF ALL OF THE PODS DIE AND THE DATA WASNT FETCHED FROM A
    PERMANENT SOURCE, THAT DATA WILL BE LOST
