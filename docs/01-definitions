// POD
    SMALLEST UNIT OF K8
    ABSTRACTION OVER A DOCKER CONTAINER
    STANDARD IS TO RUN ONE APP PER POD
    WITHIN KUBERNETES, EACH POD GETS ITS OWN IP
        USED TO COMMUNICATE WITH EACH OTHER
    EPHEMERAL IN NATURE

// SERVICE
    STATIC IP ADDRESS THAT IS ASSIGNED TO A POD
    LIFECYCLE OF POD AND SERVICE IS NOT CONNECTED
        IF A POD CRASHES AND A NEW ONE IS CREATED
        THE SERVICE IP STAYS THE SAME
    
    INTERNAL SERVICES ARE ONLY AVAILABLE TO OTHER PODS
        LIKE A DATABASE
    EXTERNAL SERVICES ARE AVAILABLE TO EVERYONE
        LIKE A WEBSITE
        USES THE SERVICES IP ADDRESS, NOT THE HOSTS
    INGRESS SERVICES
        A SECURE HTTPS ADDRESS THAT FORWARDS TO THE SERVICE IP
    
    SERVICES ARE ALSO BUILT-IN LOAD BALANCERS

    // CONFIG MAP
        EXTERNAL CONFIGURATION OF YOUR APPLICATION
        KIND OF LIKE ENVIRONMENT VARIABLES
        FOR NON-SENSITIVE DATA
        STORED IN PLAIN TEXT

    // SECRETS
        SIMILAR TO CONFIG MAP
        FOR SENSITIVE DATA, LIKE PASSWORDS AND API KEYS
        STORED AS BASE64 ENCODED
        SECRETS SHOULD BE DEPLOYED BEFORE COMPONENTS THAT REQUIRE THEM

// DATA STORAGE
    PERMANENT DATA SHOULD NOT BE STORED IN AN EPHEMERAL POD
    IT IS INSTEAD STORED IN SOMETHING CALLED A VOLUME
        KUBERNETES MOUNTS AN EXTERNAL DIRECTORY
        SIMILAR TO HOW YOU DO IT IN DOCKER
    STORAGE IS CONSIDERED TO BE A SEPARATE MODULE
    THE KUBERNETER CLUSTERS TASK IS NOT TO STORAGE

// NODE
    A NODE CONTAINS ALL THE INDIVIDUAL SERVICE COMPONENTS FOR THE APP TO WORK
    IN OTHER WORDS, A NODE CONTAINS A NUMBER OF PODS

// DEPLOYMENTS
    KUBERNETES CLUSTERS ARE DEFINED IN A BLUEPRINT YAML FILE
    HERE YOU DEFINE DOCKER IMAGE
    AND SPECIFY HOW MANY INSTANCES YOU WOULD LIKE
    KUBERNETES AUTOMATICALLY LOAD BALANCES BETWEEN THE INSTANCES
    IF ONE INSTANCE CRASHES, ANOTHER ONE IS CREATED
    AND THE OLD ONE IS TERMINATED

    YOU SELDOMLY DEAL WITH PODS DIRECTLY, AND INSTEAD CONFIGURE DEPLOYMENTS

// STATEFUL SET
    DATABASES HAVE NUMEROUS ISSUES WITH INSTANCED CONNECTIONS
        DUE TO THIS, NORMAL SERVICES ARE A BAD FIT
    "STATEFUL SET" COMPONENTS ARE A GOOD ALTERNATIVE
        SYNCHRONIZES READING AND WRITING
    USING THIS COMPONENT IS CAN BE QUITE DIFFICULT/ANNOYING
    USING AN EXTERNAL GRAPHQL/REST API MIGHT BE SMARTER
