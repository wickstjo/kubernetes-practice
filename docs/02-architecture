A NODE NEEDS A CONTAINER RUNTIME
    LIKE DOCKER

KUBELET
    INTERACTS WITH THE NODE AND CONTAINER
    STARTS THE POD WITH A CONTAINER INSIDE

KUBE PROXY
    LOAD BALANCES & FORWARDS REQUESTS TO NODES
    ALSO OPTIMIZES

// MASTER NODES
    MANAGE A NUMEBR OF SLAVE NODES
    REQUIRE A RELATIVELY LOW AMOUNT OF RESOURCES
    CONSISTS OF 4 MAIN COMPONENTS

    1. API SERVER
        FUNCTIONS LIKE THE CLUSTER'S "GATEWAY"
            CAN BE INTERACTED WITH THROUGH A CLI
            OR LOCALHOST DASHBOARD TOOL
        ACTS AS A GATEKEEPER FOR AUTHENTICATION

        REQUEST => API SERVER => VALIDATE REQUEST => PERFORM ACTION

    2. SCHEDULER
        VALIDATED REQUESTS ARE FORWARDED TO THE SCHEDULER
        DECIDES THE OPTIMAL WAY OF COMPLETING THE REQUEST

    3. CONTROLLER MANAGER
        DETECTS CLUSTER STATE CHANGES

    4. ETCD
        KEY-VALUE STORE OF THE CLUSTER STATE
        ESSENTIALLY THE CLUSTERS BRAIN
        THE OTHER COMPONENTS IDENTIFY PROBLEMS THROUGH THE BRAIN
        THIS COMPONENT CONTAINS NO APP DATA
        WHEN THERE ARE MULTIPLE MASTER NODES, THE BRAIN TENDS TO BE SHARED
    
// SLAVE NODES
    THESE NODES DO THE ACTUAL WORK
    REQUIRE MUCH MORE RESOURCES THAN MASTER NODES

// EXAMPLE SETUP
    THERE ARE NO STRICT RATIO REQUIREMENTS
    A NORMAL CLUSTER MIGHT CONSIST OF
        2 MASTER NODES
        4 SLAVE NODES
    AS COMPLEXITY GROWS
        EITHER NODE TYPES CAN BE ADDED/REMOVED ON THE FLY
