PODS ARE CREATED TO BE EPHEMERAL
WHEN ONE IS TERMINATED, ITS GENERATED DATA IS ALSO LOST
PERSISTENCY IS GAINED THROUGH "VOLUMES"

// WHY VOLUMES ARE NECESSARY
    EVEN THROUGH KUBERNETES IS DESIGNED TO BE RESISTANT TO CRASHES
    PERSISTENT DATA SHOULD ALSO BE RETAINED IF THE ENTIRE CLUSTER CRASHES
    THIS CALLS FOR AN EXTERNAL DRIVE/DIRECTORY

    THEREFORE, PERSISTENT VOLUMES ARE ALWAYS AN EXTERNAL PLUGIN
    TO AN EPHEMERAL KUBERNETES CLUSTER

    THERE ARE OVER 25 SUPPORTED VOLUME BACKENDS SUPPORTED BY KUBERNETES
    THEIR CONFIGS DIFFER SLIGHTLY, SO JUST GOOGLE SPECIFICS

// PERSISTENT & NON-PERSISTENT VOLUMES
    VOLUMES CAN BE OF THE TYPES
        LOCAL
        REMOTE
    BOTH HAVE THEIR OWN USECASES, BUT IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT
    LOCAL VOLUMES VIOLATE MULTIPLE RULES OF DATA PERSISTENCY

    PERSISTENT VOLUMES ARE AVAILABLE TO ALL NODES
    LOCAL VOLUMES ARE BOUND TO NAMESPACES

// CONFIGMAPS & SECRETS
    MUCH LIKE CONFIGMAPS AND SECRETS, VOLUMES MUST EXIST BEFORE
    COMPONENTS THAT USE DEPEND ON THEM

    THEY ARE BOTH LOCAL VOLUMES BUT COME WITH READY MADE
    WRAPPERS FOR EASE-OF-USE.

// CREATION & CLAIMS
    NETWORK ENGINEERS USUALLY MAKE VOLUMES AVAILABLE ON THE CLUSTER

    THEN PROGRAMMERS CLAIM PARTITIONS OF THE VOLUME TO THEIR COMPONENTS

    CLAIMS ARE MADE USING YAML FILES JUST LIKE CREATING COMPONENTS

    PODS THAT USE VOLUMES MUST SPECIFY THIS IN THEIR YAML CONFIG

    LOCAL VOLUMES MUST EXIST IN THE SAME NAMESPACE AS THE
    COMPONENT THAT CLAIMS IT

// STORAGE CLASS
    CREATION AND REMOVAL OF VOLUMES CAN BE AUTOMATED WITH
    THE STORAGE CLASS COMPONENT

    THESE ARE CREATED VIA YAML FILE

    IT AUTOMATICALLY CREATES AND RESERVES SPACE WHEN
    IT THAT SPACE IS CLAIMED BY A COMPONENT
